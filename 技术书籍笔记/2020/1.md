1 std :: move函数不会移动任何东西。
就其本身而言 执行无条件强制转换为右值。
std::move doesn’t move anything.
2 如果本地对象否则有资格进行返回值优化，则切勿将std :: move应用于本地对象。

------------------------------
Item 23: Understand std::move and std::forward.
It’s useful to approach std::move  in terms of what they don’t do.
std::move doesn’t move anything.

Things to Remember
1 std::move performs an unconditional cast to an rvalue. In and of itself, it
doesn’t move anything.
2 Neither std::move  do anything at runtime.
3 Never apply std::move to local objects if they would other-wise be eligible for the return value optimization.
