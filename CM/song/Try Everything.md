I messed up tonight, I lost another fight

今晚簡直一團亂，又輸了一場戰

I still mess up but I'll just start again

依舊亂糟糟，就重新開始

I keep falling down, I keep on hitting the ground

跌跌撞撞，挫折接踵而來

I always get up now to see what's next

我只是努力站起來，接受下一個挑戰

Birds don't just fly, they fall down and get up

在學習的過程必定傷痕累累

Nobody learns without getting it wrong

沒有失敗，哪來的成功

I won't give up, no I won't give in

永不放棄，永不屈服

Till I reach the end and then I'll start again

有始有終，不斷的磨練自我

No I won't leave, I wanna try everything

絕不喊停，我無所不試

I wanna try even though I could fail

就算失敗，仍然勇敢嘗試

I won't give up, no I won't give in

永不放棄，永不屈服

Til I reach the end and then I'll start again

在抵達終點前絕不暫停

No I won't leave, I wanna try everything

我不願逃避，我想盡全力

I wanna try even though I could fail

儘管會失敗，卻不想有遺憾

Oh, oh, oh, oh, ohh Try everything  x3

我無所不試

 

Look at how far you've come, you filled your heart with love

見你從遙遠的另一方來此，內心充滿愛的光輝

Baby you've done enough, take a deep breath

深呼吸一口氣，你做的夠多了

Don't beat yourself up, don't need to run so fast

不必給自己壓力，慢工出細活

Sometimes we come last, but we did our best

就算最後一名，至少我們盡力了

I won't give up, no I won't give in

永不放棄，永不投降

Til I reach the end and then I'll start again

抵達終點的前一刻絕不怠懈

No I won't leave, I wanna try everything

絕不逃避，把握機會

I wanna try even though I could fail

就算失敗，卻毫無遺憾

I won't give up, no I won't give in

永不放棄，永不喊停

Til I reach the end and then I'll start again

每一天，挑戰極限

No I won't leave, I wanna try everything

我不會逃避，直至盡全力

I wanna try even though I could fail

就算會失敗，仍不斷嘗試

I'll keep on making those new mistakes

將錯誤轉換為動力

I'll keep on making them every day

每一天奮力挑戰

Those new mistakes

那些挫折

Oh, oh, oh, oh, ohh Try everything  x3
