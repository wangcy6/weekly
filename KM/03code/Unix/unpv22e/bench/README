     Not all of the tests in this directory run on all systems.
First execute "make clean" and then build all the programs that will
compile: "make -i".  You will get an error for every program that will
not compile, but at the end the only executables are the ones that will
run.

     Then run "bw_lat.sh" and "incr.sh" to measure the bandwidth,
latency, and synchronization times.  Notice that these two shell scripts
require at least the 1993 KornShell (ksh93) and they skip any executable
that does not exist.

	The three files "lat_signal.c", "lat_sigwait.c", and
"lat_sigqueue.c" were developed after the book was published and
were not in the source code tar ball until Sept. 21, 1998.  These
three programs measure the latency involved when using signals as
a form of IPC (which should not really be done).
