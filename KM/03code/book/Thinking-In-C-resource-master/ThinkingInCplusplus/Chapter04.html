<DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><P><FONT FACE="Verdana" SIZE=4>C++ is a productivity enhancement
tool. Why else </FONT><BR><FONT FACE="Verdana" SIZE=4>would you make the effort
(and it is an effort, </FONT><BR><FONT FACE="Verdana" SIZE=4>regardless of how
easy we attempt to make the transition)</FONT><BR></P></DIV>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><P><FONT FACE="Georgia">to switch from some language that you
already know and are productive with to a new language in which you&#8217;re
going to be <I>less</I> productive for a while, until you get the hang of it?
It&#8217;s because you&#8217;ve become convinced that you&#8217;re going to get
big gains by using this new tool.</FONT><BR></P></DIV>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><P><FONT FACE="Georgia">Productivity, in computer programming
terms, means that fewer people can make much more complex and impressive
programs in less time. There are certainly other issues when it comes to
choosing a language, such as efficiency (does the nature of the language cause
slowdown and code bloat?), safety (does the language help you ensure that your
program will always do what you plan, and handle errors gracefully?), and
maintenance (does the language help you create code that is easy to understand,
modify, and extend?). These are certainly important factors that will be
examined in this book.</FONT><BR></P></DIV>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><P><FONT FACE="Georgia">But raw productivity means a program that
formerly took three of you a week to write now takes one of you a day or two.
This touches several levels of economics. You&#8217;re happy because you get the
rush of power that comes from building something, your client (or boss) is happy
because products are produced faster and with fewer people, and the customers
are happy because they get products more cheaply. The only way to get massive
increases in productivity is to leverage off other people&#8217;s code. That is,
to use libraries.</FONT><BR></P></DIV>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><P><FONT FACE="Georgia">A library<A NAME="Index964"></A> is
simply a bunch of code that someone else has written and packaged together.
Often, the most minimal package is a file with an extension like <B>lib</B> and
one or more header files to tell your compiler what&#8217;s in the library. The
linker knows how to search through the library file and extract the appropriate
compiled code. But that&#8217;s only one way to deliver a library. On platforms
that span many architectures, such as Linux/Unix, often the only sensible way to
deliver a library is with source code, so it can be reconfigured and recompiled
on the new target.</FONT><BR></P></DIV>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><P><FONT FACE="Georgia">Thus, libraries are probably the most
important way to improve productivity, and one of the primary design goals of
C++ is to make library use easier. This implies that there&#8217;s something
hard about using libraries in C. Understanding this factor will give you a first
insight into the design of C++, and thus insight into how to use
it.</FONT><A NAME="_Toc312373821"></A><A NAME="_Toc472654815"></A><BR></P></DIV>

A tiny C-like library</H2></FONT>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><P><FONT FACE="Georgia">A library usually starts out as a
collection of functions, but if you have used third-party
<A NAME="Index965"></A><A NAME="Index966"></A>C libraries you know there&#8217;s
usually more to it than that because there&#8217;s more to life than
<A NAME="Index967"></A>behavior, actions, and functions. There are also
<A NAME="Index968"></A>characteristics (blue, pounds, texture, luminance), which
are represented by data. And when you start to deal with a set of
characteristics in C, it is very convenient to clump them together into a
<A NAME="Index969"></A><B>struct</B>, especially if you want to represent more
than one similar thing in your problem space. Then you can make a variable of
this <B>struct</B> for each thing.</FONT><BR></P></DIV>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><P><FONT FACE="Georgia">Thus, most C libraries have a set of
<B>struct</B>s and a set of functions that act on those <B>struct</B>s. As an
example of what such a system looks like, consider a programming tool that acts
like an array, but whose size can be established at runtime, when it is created.
I&#8217;ll call it a <B>CStash</B>. Although it&#8217;s written in C++, it has
the style of what you&#8217;d write in C:

<DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><P><FONT FACE="Georgia"><B>initialize(&#160;)</B> performs the
necessary setup for <B>struct CStash</B> by setting the internal variables to
appropriate values. Initially, the <B>storage</B> pointer is set to zero &#8211;
no initial storage is allocated.</FONT><BR></P></DIV>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><P><FONT FACE="Georgia">The <B>add(&#160;)</B> function inserts
an element into the <B>CStash</B> at the next available location. First, it
checks to see if there is any available space left. If not, it expands the
storage using the <B>inflate(&#160;)</B> function, described
later.</FONT><BR></P></DIV>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><P><FONT FACE="Georgia">Because the compiler doesn&#8217;t know
the specific type of the variable being stored (all the function gets is a
<B>void*</B>), you can&#8217;t just do an assignment, which would certainly be
the convenient thing. Instead, you must copy the variable byte-by-byte. The most
straightforward way to perform the copying is with array indexing. Typically,
there are already data bytes in <B>storage</B>, and this is indicated by the
value of <B>next</B>. To start with the right byte offset, <B>next</B> is
multiplied by the size of each element (in bytes) to produce <B>startBytes</B>.
Then the argument <B>element</B> is cast to an <B>unsigned char</B>* so that it
can be addressed byte-by-byte and copied into the available <B>storage</B>
space. <B>next</B> is incremented so that it indicates the next available piece
of storage, and the &#8220;index number&#8221; where the value was stored so
that value can be retrieved using this index number with
<B>fetch(&#160;)</B>.</FONT><BR></P></DIV>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><P><FONT FACE="Georgia"><B>fetch(&#160;) </B>checks to see that
the index isn&#8217;t out of bounds and then returns the address of the desired
variable, calculated using the <B>index</B> argument. Since <B>index
</B>indicates the number of elements to offset into the <B>CStash</B>, it must
be multiplied by the number of bytes occupied by each piece to produce the
numerical offset in bytes. When this offset is used to index into <B>storage
</B>using array indexing, you don&#8217;t get the address, but instead the byte
at the address. To produce the address, you must use the address-of operator
<B>&amp;</B>. </FONT><BR></P></DIV>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><P><FONT FACE="Georgia"><B>count(&#160;)</B> may look a bit
strange at first to a seasoned C programmer. It seems like a lot of trouble to
go through to do something that would probably be a lot easier to do by hand. If
you have a <B>struct CStash</B> called <B>intStash</B>, for example, it would
seem much more straightforward to find out how many elements it has by saying
<B>intStash.next</B> instead of making a function call (which has overhead),
such as <B>count(&amp;intStash)</B>. However, if you wanted to change the
internal representation of <B>CStash</B> and thus the way the count was
calculated, the function call interface allows the necessary flexibility. But
alas, most programmers won&#8217;t bother to find out about your
&#8220;better&#8221; design for the library. They&#8217;ll look at the
<B>struct</B> and grab the <B>next</B> value directly, and possibly even change
<B>next</B> without your permission. If only there were some way for the library
designer to have better control over things like this! (Yes, that&#8217;s
foreshadowing.)</FONT><A NAME="_Toc312373822"></A><A NAME="_Toc472654816"></A><BR></P></DIV>

Dynamic storage

<DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><P><FONT FACE="Georgia">You never know the maximum amount of
storage you might need for a <B>CStash</B>, so the memory pointed to by
<B>storage</B> is allocated from the <I>heap</I>. The
heap<A NAME="Index980"></A> is a big block of memory used for allocating smaller
pieces at runtime. You use the heap when you don&#8217;t know the size of the
memory you&#8217;ll need while you&#8217;re writing a program. That is, only at
runtime will you find out that you need space to hold 200 <B>Airplane</B>
variables instead of 20. In Standard C, dynamic-memory allocation functions
include <B>malloc(&#160;)<A NAME="Index981"></A></B>,
<B>calloc(&#160;)<A NAME="Index982"></A></B>,
<B>realloc(&#160;)<A NAME="Index983"></A></B>, and
<B>free(&#160;)<A NAME="Index984"></A></B>. Instead of library calls, however,
C++ has a more sophisticated (albeit simpler to use) approach to dynamic memory
that is integrated into the language via the keywords
<A NAME="Index985"></A><A NAME="Index986"></A><B>new</B> and
<A NAME="Index987"></A><A NAME="Index988"></A><B>delete</B>.</FONT><BR></P></DIV>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><P><FONT FACE="Georgia">The <B>inflate(&#160;)</B> function uses
<B>new</B> to get a bigger chunk of space for the <B>CStash</B>. In this
situation, we will only expand memory and not shrink it, and the
<A NAME="Index989"></A><B>assert(&#160;)</B> will guarantee that a negative
number is not passed to <B>inflate(&#160;)</B> as the <B>increase</B> value. The
new number of elements that can be held (after <B>inflate(&#160;)</B> completes)
is calculated as <B>newQuantity</B>, and this is multiplied by the number of
bytes per element to produce <B>newBytes</B>, which will be the number of bytes
in the allocation. So that we know how many bytes to copy over from the old
location, <B>oldBytes</B> is calculated using the old
<B>quantity</B>.</FONT><BR></P></DIV>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><P><FONT FACE="Georgia">The actual storage allocation occurs in
the <A NAME="Index990"></A><I>new-expression</I>, which is the expression

<DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><P><FONT FACE="Georgia"><B>new Type;</B></FONT><BR></P></DIV>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><P><FONT FACE="Georgia">in which <B>Type</B> describes the type
of variable you want allocated on the heap. In this case, we want an array of
<B>unsigned char</B> that is <B>newBytes</B> long, so that is what appears as
the <B>Type</B>. You can also allocate something as simple as an <B>int</B> by
saying:</FONT><BR></P></DIV>
<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT SIZE = "+1"><PRE><font color=#0000ff>new</font> <font color=#0000ff>int</font>;</PRE></FONT></BLOCKQUOTE>

<DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><P><FONT FACE="Georgia">and although this is rarely done, you can
see that the form is consistent.</FONT><BR></P></DIV>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><P><FONT FACE="Georgia">A new-expression returns a <I>pointer</I>
to an object of the exact type that you asked for. So if you say <B>new
Type</B>, you get back a pointer to a <B>Type</B>.<B> </B>If you say <B>new
int</B>, you get back a pointer to an <B>int</B>. If you want a <B>new</B>
<B>unsigned char</B> array, you get back a pointer to the first element of that
array. The compiler will ensure that you assign the return value of the
new-expression to a pointer of the correct type.</FONT><BR></P></DIV>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><P><FONT FACE="Georgia">Of course, any time you request memory
it&#8217;s possible for the request to fail, if there is no more memory. As you
will learn, C++ has mechanisms that come into play if the memory-allocation
operation is unsuccessful.</FONT><BR></P></DIV>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><P><FONT FACE="Georgia">Once the new storage is allocated, the
data in the old storage must be copied to the new storage; this is again
accomplished with array indexing, copying one byte at a time in a loop. After
the data is copied, the old storage must be released so that it can be used by
other parts of the program if they need new storage. The <B>delete</B> keyword
is the complement of <B>new</B>, and must be applied to release any storage that
is allocated with <B>new</B> (if you forget to use <B>delete</B>, that storage
remains unavailable, and if this so-called
<A NAME="Index991"></A><A NAME="Index992"></A><I>memory leak </I>happens enough,
you&#8217;ll run out of memory). In addition, there&#8217;s a special syntax
when you&#8217;re deleting an array. It&#8217;s as if you must remind the
compiler that this pointer is not just pointing to one object, but to an array
of objects: you put a set of empty square brackets in front of the pointer to be
deleted:</FONT><BR></P></DIV>
<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT SIZE = "+1"><PRE><font color=#0000ff>delete</font> []myArray;</PRE></FONT></BLOCKQUOTE>

<DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><P><FONT FACE="Georgia">Once the old storage has been deleted,
the pointer to the new storage can be assigned to the <B>storage</B> pointer,
the quantity is adjusted, and <B>inflate(&#160;)</B> has completed its
job.</FONT><BR></P></DIV>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><P><FONT FACE="Georgia">Note that the heap manager is fairly
primitive. It gives you chunks of memory and takes them back when you
<B>delete</B> them. There&#8217;s no inherent facility for
<A NAME="Index993"></A><I>heap compaction</I>, which compresses the heap to
provide bigger free chunks. If a program allocates and frees heap storage for a
while, you can end up with a
<A NAME="Index994"></A><A NAME="Index995"></A><I>fragmented</I> heap that has
lots of memory free, but without any pieces that are big enough to allocate the
size you&#8217;re looking for at the moment. A <A NAME="Index996"></A>heap
compactor complicates a program because it moves memory chunks around, so your
pointers won&#8217;t retain their proper values. Some operating environments
have heap compaction built in, but they require you to use special memory
<I>handles</I> (which can be temporarily converted to pointers, after locking
the memory so the heap compactor can&#8217;t move it) instead of pointers. You
can also build your own heap-compaction scheme, but this is not a task to be
undertaken lightly.</FONT><BR></P></DIV>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><P><FONT FACE="Georgia">When you create a
<A NAME="Index997"></A><A NAME="Index998"></A>variable on the stack at
compile-time, the storage for that variable is automatically created and freed
by the compiler. The compiler knows exactly how much storage is needed, and it
knows the lifetime of the variables because of scoping. With dynamic memory
allocation, however, the compiler doesn&#8217;t know how much storage
you&#8217;re going to need, <I>and</I> it doesn&#8217;t know the lifetime of
that storage. That is, the storage doesn&#8217;t get cleaned up automatically.

Bad guesses</H3></FONT>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><P><FONT FACE="Georgia">There is one more important issue you
should understand before we look at the general problems in creating a C
library. Note that the <B>CLib.h</B> header file <I>must</I> be included in any
file that refers to <B>CStash</B> because the compiler can&#8217;t even guess at
what that structure looks like. However, it <I>can</I> guess at what a function
looks like; this sounds like a feature but it turns out to be a major
<A NAME="Index1004"></A>C <A NAME="Index1005"></A>pitfall.</FONT><BR></P></DIV>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><P><FONT FACE="Georgia">Although you should always declare
functions by including a header file,
<A NAME="Index1006"></A><A NAME="Index1007"></A>function declarations
aren&#8217;t essential in C. It&#8217;s possible in C (but <I>not </I>in C++) to
call a function that you haven&#8217;t declared. A good compiler will warn you
that you probably ought to declare a function first, but it isn&#8217;t enforced
by the C language standard. This is a dangerous practice, because the C compiler
can assume that a function that you call with an <B>int</B> argument has an
argument list containing <B>int</B>, even if it may actually contain a
<B>float</B>.<B> </B>This can produce bugs that are very difficult to find, as
you will see.</FONT><BR></P></DIV>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><P><FONT FACE="Georgia">Each separate C implementation file (with
an extension of <B>.c</B>)<B> </B>is a
<A NAME="Index1008"></A><A NAME="Index1009"></A><I>translation unit</I>. That
is, the compiler is run separately on each translation unit, and when it is
running it is aware of only that unit. Thus, any information you provide by
including header files is quite important because it determines the
compiler&#8217;s understanding of the rest of your program. Declarations in
header files are particularly important, because everywhere the header is
included, the compiler will know exactly what to do. If, for example, you have a
declaration in a header file that says <B>void func(float)</B>, the compiler
knows that if you call that function with an integer argument, it should
convert<A NAME="Index1010"></A><A NAME="Index1011"></A><A NAME="Index1012"></A>
the <B>int</B> to a <B>float</B> as it passes the argument (this is called
<I>promotion</I>). Without the declaration, the C compiler would simply assume
that a function <B>func(int)</B> existed, it wouldn&#8217;t do the promotion,
and the wrong data would quietly be passed into
<B>func(&#160;)</B>.</FONT><BR></P></DIV>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><P><FONT FACE="Georgia">For each translation unit, the compiler
creates an <A NAME="Index1013"></A>object file, with an extension of <B>.o</B>
or <B>.obj</B> or something similar. These object files, along with the
necessary start-up code, must be collected by the linker
<A NAME="Index1014"></A>into the executable program. During linking, all the
external references must be resolved. For example, in <B>CLibTest.cpp</B>,
functions such as <B>initialize(&#160;)</B> and <B>fetch(&#160;)</B> are
declared (that is, the compiler is told what they look like) and used, but not
defined. They are defined elsewhere, in <B>CLib.cpp</B>. Thus, the calls in
<B>CLib.cpp</B> are external references. The linker must, when it puts all the
object files together, take the unresolved external references
<A NAME="Index1015"></A><A NAME="Index1016"></A>and find the addresses they
actually refer to. Those addresses are put into the executable program to
replace the external references.</FONT><BR></P></DIV>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><P><FONT FACE="Georgia">It&#8217;s important to realize that in
C, the external references that the linker searches for are simply function
names, generally with an underscore in front of them. So all the linker has to
do is match up the function name where it is called and the function body in the
object file, and it&#8217;s done. If you accidentally made a call that the
compiler interpreted as <B>func(int)</B> and there&#8217;s a function body for
<B>func(float)</B> in some other object file, the linker will see <B>_func</B>
in one place and <B>_func</B> in another, and it will think everything&#8217;s
OK. The <B>func(&#160;)</B> at the calling location will push an <B>int</B> onto
the stack, and the <B>func(&#160;)</B> function body will expect a <B>float</B>
to be on the stack. If the function only reads the value and doesn&#8217;t write
to it, it won&#8217;t blow up the stack. In fact, the <B>float</B> value it
reads off the stack might even make some kind of sense. That&#8217;s worse
because it&#8217;s harder to find the
bug.</FONT><A NAME="_Toc312373825"></A><A NAME="_Toc472654818"></A><BR></P></DIV>

<DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><P><FONT FACE="Georgia">We are remarkably adaptable, even in
situations in which perhaps we <I>shouldn&#8217;t</I> adapt. The style of the
<B>CStash</B> library has been a staple for C programmers, but if you look at it
for a while, you might notice that it&#8217;s rather . . . awkward. When you use
it, you have to pass the address of the structure to every single function in
the library. When reading the code, the mechanism of the library gets mixed with
the meaning of the function calls, which is confusing when you&#8217;re trying
to understand what&#8217;s going on.</FONT><BR></P></DIV>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><P><FONT FACE="Georgia">One of the biggest obstacles, however, to
using libraries in C is the problem of <I>name
clashes<A NAME="Index1017"></A></I>.<A NAME="Index1018"></A> C has a single
<A NAME="Index1019"></A>name space for functions; that is, when the linker looks
for a function name, it looks in a single master list. In addition, when the
compiler is working on a translation unit, it can work only with a single
function with a given name.</FONT><BR></P></DIV>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><P><FONT FACE="Georgia">Now suppose you decide to buy two
libraries from two different vendors, and each library has a structure that must
be initialized and cleaned up. Both vendors decided that
<B>initialize(&#160;)</B> and <B>cleanup(&#160;)</B> are good names. If you
include both their header files in a single translation unit, what does the C
compiler do? Fortunately, C gives you an error, telling you there&#8217;s a type
mismatch in the two different argument lists of the declared functions. But even
if you don&#8217;t include them in the same translation unit, the linker will
still have problems. A good linker will detect that there&#8217;s a name clash,
but some linkers take the first function name they find, by searching through
the list of object files in the order you give them in the link list. (This can
even be thought of as a feature because it allows you to replace a library
function with your own version.)</FONT><BR></P></DIV>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><P><FONT FACE="Georgia">In either event, you can&#8217;t use two
C libraries that contain a function with the identical name. To solve this

<B>cleanup(&#160;)</B> might become <B>CStash_initialize(&#160;)</B> and

declaration by including the header file. If you also include the same header

library is no longer explicit. It&#8217;s still there, of course, because the
function has to be able to work on a particular <B>struct</B> variable. But
notice, inside the member function, that the member selection is also gone!
Thus, instead of saying <B>s&#8211;&gt;size = sz;</B> you say <B>size = sz;</B>
and eliminate the tedious <B>s&#8211;&gt;</B>, which didn&#8217;t really add
anything to the meaning of what you were doing anyway. The C++ compiler is
apparently doing this for you. Indeed, it is taking the &#8220;secret&#8221;
first argument (the address of the structure that we were previously passing in
by hand) and applying the member selector whenever you refer to one of the data
members of a <B>struct</B>.
<A NAME="Index1054"></A><A NAME="Index1055"></A><A NAME="Index1056"></A><A NAME="Index1057"></A><A NAME="Index1058"></A>This
means that whenever you are inside the member function of another <B>struct</B>,
you can refer to any member (including another member function) by simply giving
its name. The compiler will search through the local structure&#8217;s names
before looking for a global version of that name. You&#8217;ll find that this
feature means that not only is your code easier to write, it&#8217;s a lot
easier to read.</FONT><BR></P></DIV>

consistent. There&#8217;s a special keyword, called
<A NAME="Index1059"></A><B>this<A NAME="Index1060"></A></B>, which produces the

there was no complaint from the compiler. But in C++, this statement is not
allowed. Why? Because C is not so particular about type information, so it
allows you to assign a pointer with an unspecified type to a pointer with a
specified type. Not so with C++. Type is critical in C++, and the compiler
stamps its foot when there are any violations of type information. This has
always been important, but it is especially important in C++ because you have
member functions in <B>struct</B>s. If you could pass pointers to <B>struct</B>s
around with impunity in C++, then you could end up calling a member function for
a <B>struct</B> that doesn&#8217;t even logically exist for that <B>struct</B>!
A real recipe for disaster. Therefore, while C++ allows the assignment of any
type of pointer to a <A NAME="Index1063"></A><B>void*</B> (this was the original
intent of <B>void*</B>, which is required to be large enough to hold a pointer
to any type), it will <I>not</I> allow you to assign a <B>void</B> pointer to
any other type of pointer. A cast is always required to tell the reader and the
compiler that you really do want to treat it as the destination type.

<DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><P><FONT FACE="Georgia">Now that you&#8217;ve seen an initial
example, it&#8217;s time to step back and take a look at some terminology. The
act of bringing functions inside structures is the root of what C++ adds to C,
and it introduces a new way of thinking about structures: as concepts. In C, a
<B>struct</B> <A NAME="Index1083"></A>is an agglomeration of data, a way to
package data so you can treat it in a clump. But it&#8217;s hard to think about
it as anything but a programming convenience. The functions that operate on
those structures are elsewhere. However, with functions in the package, the
structure becomes a new creature, capable of describing both characteristics
(like a C <B>struct</B> does) <I>and</I> behaviors. The concept of an object, a
free-standing, bounded entity that can remember <I>and</I> act, suggests
itself.</FONT><BR></P></DIV>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><P><FONT FACE="Georgia">In C++, an object is just a variable, and
the purest definition is &#8220;a region of storage&#8221; (this is a more
specific way of saying, &#8220;an object must have a unique
<A NAME="Index1084"></A>identifier,&#8221; which in the case of C++ is a unique
memory address). It&#8217;s a place where you can store data, and it&#8217;s
implied that there are also operations that can be performed on this
data.</FONT><BR></P></DIV>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><P><FONT FACE="Georgia">Unfortunately, there&#8217;s not complete
consistency across languages when it comes to these terms, although they are
fairly well-accepted. You will also sometimes encounter disagreement about what
an object-oriented language is, although that seems to be reasonably well sorted
out by now. There are languages that are
<I>object-based<A NAME="Index1085"></A></I>, which means that they have objects
like the C++ structures-with-functions that you&#8217;ve seen so far. This,
however, is only part of the picture when it comes to an object-oriented
language, and languages that stop at packaging functions inside data structures
are object-based, not

create a <B>float</B> by saying <B>float f</B>. A <B>Stash</B> also has
characteristics and behavior. Even though it acts like a real, built-in data
type, we refer to it as an
<A NAME="Index1087"></A><A NAME="Index1088"></A><A NAME="Index1089"></A><I>abstract
data type</I>, perhaps because it allows us to abstract a concept from the
problem space into the solution space. In addition, the C++ compiler treats it
like a new data type, and if you say a function expects a <B>Stash</B>, the
compiler makes sure you pass a <B>Stash</B> to that function. So the same level
of type checking happens with abstract data types (sometimes called

with built-in types.</FONT><BR></P></DIV>

Many C books don&#8217;t seem to emphasize it, and the compiler didn&#8217;t
enforce function declarations, so it seemed optional most of the time, except
when structures were declared. In C++ the use of header files becomes crystal
clear. They are virtually mandatory for easy program development, and you put
very specific information in them: <A NAME="Index1111"></A>declarations. The
header file tells the compiler what is available in your library. You can use

consistency in libraries, and reduces bugs by forcing the same interface to be

<DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><P><FONT FACE="Georgia">The header is a contract between you and
the user of your library. The contract describes your data structures, and
states the arguments and return values for the function calls. It says,
&#8220;Here&#8217;s what my library does.&#8221; The user needs some of this
information to develop the application and the compiler needs all of it to
generate proper code. The user of the <B>struct</B> simply includes the header
file, creates objects (instances) of that <B>struct</B>, and links in the object
module or library (i.e.: the compiled code).</FONT><BR></P></DIV>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><P><FONT FACE="Georgia">The compiler enforces the contract by
requiring you to declare all structures and functions before they are used and,
in the case of member functions, before they are defined. Thus, you&#8217;re
forced to put the declarations in the header and to include the header in the
file where the member functions are defined and the file(s) where they are used.
Because a single header file describing your library is included throughout the
system, the compiler can ensure consistency and <A NAME="Index1121"></A>prevent
errors.</FONT><BR></P></DIV>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><P><FONT FACE="Georgia">There are certain issues that you must be
aware of in order to organize your code
properly<A NAME="Index1122"></A><A NAME="Index1123"></A> and write effective
header files. The first issue concerns what you can put into header files. The
basic rule is &#8220;only declarations<A NAME="Index1124"></A>,&#8221; that is,
only information to the compiler but nothing that allocates storage by
generating code or creating variables. This is because the header file will
typically be included in several translation units in a project, and if storage
for one identifier is allocated in more than one place, the linker will come up
with a multiple definition error (this is C++&#8217;s
<A NAME="Index1125"></A><A NAME="Index1126"></A><I>one definition rule</I>: You
can declare things as many times as you want, but there can be only one actual
definition for each thing).</FONT><BR></P></DIV>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><P><FONT FACE="Georgia">This rule isn&#8217;t completely hard and
fast. If you define a variable that is &#8220;file
static&#8221;<A NAME="Index1127"></A> (has visibility only within a file) inside
a header file, there will be multiple instances of that data across the project,

<DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><P><FONT FACE="Georgia">The second header-file issue is this:
<A NAME="Index1133"></A><A NAME="Index1134"></A>when you put a <B>struct</B>
declaration in a header file, it is possible for the file to be included more
than once in a complicated program. Iostreams are a good example. Any time a
<B>struct</B> does I/O it may include one of the iostream headers. If the <B>cpp
</B>file you are working on uses more than one kind of <B>struct</B> (typically
including a header file for each one), you run the risk of including the
<B>&lt;iostream&gt;</B> header more than once and re-declaring
iostreams.</FONT><BR></P></DIV>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><P><FONT FACE="Georgia">The compiler considers the
<A NAME="Index1135"></A>redeclaration of a structure (this includes both
<B>struct</B>s and <B>class</B>es)<B> </B>to be an error, since it would
otherwise allow you to use the same name for different types. To prevent this
error when multiple header files are included, you need to build some
intelligence into your header files using the preprocessor
(<A NAME="Index1136"></A>Standard C++ header files like <B>&lt;iostream&gt;</B>
already have this &#8220;intelligence&#8221;).</FONT><BR></P></DIV>

In C++ this rule is especially important because if the compiler allowed you to
redeclare a structure and the two declarations differed, which one would it
use?</FONT><BR></P></DIV>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><P><FONT FACE="Georgia">The problem of redeclaration comes up
quite a bit in C++ because each data type (structure with functions) generally
has its own header file, and you have to include one header in another if you
want to create another data type that uses the first one. In any <B>cpp </B>file
in your project, it&#8217;s likely that you&#8217;ll include several files that
include the same header file. During a single compilation, the compiler can see
the same header file several times. Unless you do something about it, the
compiler will see the redeclaration of your structure and report a compile-time
error. To solve the problem, you need to know a bit more about the

<DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><P><FONT FACE="Georgia">The scope resolution operator gets you
out of situations in which the name the compiler chooses by default (the
&#8220;nearest&#8221; name) isn&#8217;t what you want. For example, suppose you
have a structure with a local identifier <B>a</B>, and you want to select a
global identifier <B>a</B> from inside a member function. The compiler would
default to choosing the local one, so you must tell it to do otherwise. When you
want to specify a global name using scope resolution, you use the
<A NAME="Index1177"></A><A NAME="Index1178"></A>operator with nothing in front
of it. Here&#8217;s an example that shows global scope resolution for both a

Summary</H2></FONT>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><P><FONT FACE="Georgia">In this chapter, you&#8217;ve learned the
fundamental &#8220;twist&#8221; of C++: that you can place functions inside of
structures. This new type of structure is called an <I>abstract data type</I>,
and variables you create using this structure are called <I>objects</I>, or
<I>instances</I>, of that type. Calling a member function for an object is
called <I>sending a message</I> to that object. The primary action in
object-oriented programming is sending messages to objects.</FONT><BR></P></DIV>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><P><FONT FACE="Georgia">Although packaging data and functions
together is a significant benefit for code organization and makes library use
easier because it prevents name clashes by hiding the names, there&#8217;s a lot
more you can do to make programming safer in C++. In the next chapter,
you&#8217;ll learn how to protect some members of a <B>struct</B> so that only
you can manipulate them. This establishes a clear boundary between what the user
of the structure can change and what only the programmer may
change.</FONT><A NAME="_Toc312373835"></A><A NAME="_Toc472654833"></A><BR></P></DIV>

<LI><FONT FACE="Verdana">	</FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia">In the Standard C library,
the function <B>puts(&#160;)</B> prints a char array to the console (so you can
say <B>puts("hello")</B>). Write a C program that uses <B>puts(&#160;) </B>but
does not include <B>&lt;stdio.h&gt; </B>or otherwise declare the function.
Compile this program with your C compiler. (Some C++ compilers are not distinct
from their C compilers; in this case you may need to discover a command-line
flag that forces a C compilation.) Now compile it with the C++ compiler and note
the
difference.</FONT><LI><FONT FACE="Verdana">	</FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia">Create a
<B>struct</B> declaration with a single member function, then create a

your solution to Exercise 2 so the <B>struct</B> is declared in a properly

another.</FONT><LI><FONT FACE="Verdana">	</FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia">Create a

second <B>int</B> argument and sets the <B>struct</B>&#8217;s <B>int</B> to the
argument value, the second displays the <B>int</B> from the <B>struct</B>. Test
the functions.
